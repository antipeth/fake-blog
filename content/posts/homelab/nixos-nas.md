## A Few Words Before

Building this NixOS NAS has been a journey of both discovery and satisfaction.
My passion for NixOS began 1 year ago when I realized that its declarative configuration model could simplify even the most complex system setups.
I decided to channel that passion into creating a robust, secure, and highly reproducible NAS solution that not only meets my storage needs but also serves as a playground for experimenting with modern technologies.

Every aspect of this system, from the carefully( maybe üôÉ) chosen hardware components to the selection of software tools, was driven by a desire for reliability and ease of management.
The declarative approach allowed me to automate almost every task.
The sense of control and precision has made managing my NAS an enjoyable and continuously rewarding experience.

It‚Äôs incredibly satisfying to see the system handle tasks flawlessly, ensuring that data is secure and always available.
The entire project is a reflection of my commitment to reproducible and declarative configurations, and it stands as a personal milestone in my ongoing exploration of NixOS.
