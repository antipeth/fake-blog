# About Me

Hey there, I'm a computer science student. I dig rock music, Linux, BSD, and all things intriguing.

# My Philosophy

Against The Philosophy of Struggling in Linux. From the Perspective of Needs, While Maintaining Curiosity and Exploration Towards New Things.

# Foundations
`FreeBSD` is my main system, and it's outstanding. It has a vast number of packages, is secure and stable, and can last for 50 years (just kidding üòÅ). I will spare no words in praising FreeBSD.

`NixOS` is another primary system for me. It has powerful features and is reproducible. It‚Äôs the most stable Linux I‚Äôve ever encountered, and unlike Debian, it doesn't suffer from a lack of old packages.

`Hyprland` is my window manager. I used `KDE` before, also a top-notch desktop environment with loads of ecosystem support, but I prefer `Hyprland` for its simplicity and customization.

`Waybar` sits atop my screen, keeping me informed.

`Nushell` is my shell. It‚Äôs written in Rust and comes with many modern features.

`Kitty` is my terminal. Chose it for better image support. Also, I might throw Alacritty on my machine too.

# My Apps

`Yazi` is my terminal file manager, crafted in Rust.

`Rofi` is my app launcher.

`Brave` is my browser, while Firefox is my backup browser.

`Neovim` is my text editor. Learning it and trying to make it my go-to for everything.

`BetterBird` is my email client, an enhanced version of Thunderbird.

`Anytype` is my note-taking and planning software. It uses blockchain technology for surprisingly fast sync speeds and is feature-packed. Anytype for everything.

`Keepassxc` keeps my passwords safe.
